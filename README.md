# Simple Python Web Scraping
In this project, I extract related information about vocabulary:
- text (.json and .csv): word, meaning, type, type, translation
- image (.png): illustration image
- audio (.mp3): audio spelling
## Tools

- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) : a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) : a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly.
